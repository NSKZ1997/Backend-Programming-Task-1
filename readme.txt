This is a simple program which contains a search engine that can look through a MongoDB database and retrieve relevant
entries. Another page can add entries to said MongoDB database. MongoDB, Socket.io, and NodeJS are required to run
this program.

This project was created to gain experience, primarily in back-end programming. It is the very first web-oriented program
I have created, so it is somewhat simple. The program also contains front-end elements in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but
the main focus of this project was the back-end part.
